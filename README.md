# 🚀 60 Days of LeetCode Challenge

Welcome to my **#60DaysOfLeetCode** challenge! This repository documents my journey to sharpen my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) skills, primarily using Java. Having tackled numerous DSA problems previously, I'm excited to dive deep again, solidify my understanding, and explore new problem-solving techniques.

This challenge is a commitment to consistent daily practice, pushing my boundaries, and continuously improving my coding prowess. I'll be sharing my thought processes, approaches, and solutions for each problem.

Feel free to explore, learn, and even suggest alternative approaches! Let's grow together in the world of algorithms.

## 🎯 Challenge Goals:

- **Consistency:** Solve at least one LeetCode problem every day for 60 consecutive days.
- **Skill Enhancement:** Deepen understanding of core DSA concepts and efficient algorithm design.
- **Problem-Solving:** Improve analytical thinking and ability to break down complex problems.
- **Java Proficiency:** Enhance fluency in Java for competitive programming and algorithm implementation.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document my thought process, approach, and code for each problem.
